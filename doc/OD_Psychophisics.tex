\section{Introduction}
\label{S:1}

One of the main challenges in scientific research is the design of an experiment. A good experimental design will make the difference between finding an answer to our research question and wasting valuable resources. Optimal Experimental Design (OED) allows us to re-interpret the design of an experiment as a decision problem where the objective is to maximize a utility function. This function is a representation of our preferences over the possible results of the experiment.

To optimize the design of an experiment, first we need to identify which of our variables are subject to this procedure. For example, we might want to select which values of an independent variable should be tested, or how many times we should test each of those values. Most of the time, these choices are made on the basis of previous research. However, it might be the case that there is not enough information to make these decisions with confidence, or that the values that are commonly used, do not allow for strong conclusions. Second, we need to formalize the objective of the experiment through a utility function. There are already examples of OED in the Psychological literature that implement different utility functions \citep[e.g.][]{Myung2009,ZL2010}. In both, the objective of the design is to discriminate between competing cognitive models, however, considerations of what makes a model ``good'' drive the authors to choose different functions.

% 1. ADD CITATIONS
In this paper, we will present a different approach where the problem is not to select between models but to make inferences about the parameters of a single one. In particular, we will present an example of OED with a model that is commonly used in Psychophysics and Decision Making, the logistic response model. %1
In this example, we will optimize an experimental design focused on studying the ability of participants to detect changes in the success rate of a probabilistic series. Additionally, we will show how different prior assumptions can change the results obtained from this process, this will highlight the importance of the choice of prior distributions in the process of designing an experiment. It is important to note that the aproach presented here follows a Bayesian perspective. A good introduction to Bayesian and other approaches to OED for GLM, and their limitations, can be found in \citet{khurietal2006}.

The rest of the paper will be organized in the following way. First, we will introduce the concepts of OED particularly in the field of Generalized linear models. Second, we will present a brief summary of the experimental problem being addressed and, a computational model which has been used to account for the behavior of human participants under similar settings. Finally, we will present the results of the optimization procedure under different prior distributions, including one generated from the model responses to simulations of the experiment.

\section{Optimal experimental design}

The concepts of OED from a decision theoretic perspective were first presented by \citet{Lindley1972}. In this work, the author argued that the design of an experiment should be approached as a decision problem. In general, one needs to specify a utility function reflecting the purpose of the experiment and then select the design which maximizes expected utility. It is also worth noting that in practice, this process will rely on the assumption of an underlying data generating model. For example, in their paper, \citet{Myung2009} use the tools of OED to optimize an experiment to discriminate between two memory retention models. In this case, the design found will be optimal only in the case that either model is true.

Under the OED framework, the problem of designing an experiment reduces to selecting a design $\eta$ from a set $H$, where data $\mathbf{y}$ will be observed given the design and a model's parameters $\theta$. The utility function $U(\eta,\mathbf{y},\theta)$, maps the values of these variables to the Real numbers. For this example, the objective will be to select the $n$ values of an independent variable $x$ from an experimental space $X$. This space can be thought of as the numerical variables which can be controlled by the experimenter. The design $\eta$, will be the weight of our observations assigned to each of the $n$ design points $\eta_i=n_i/n$, with the constraint that  $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\eta_i = 1$. In this case, $\eta$ can be interpreted as a probability measure over the experimenral space.

The expected utility of a design $\eta$ is represented by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
U(\eta)=\int \int U(\eta,y,\theta)p(\theta|y,\eta)p(y|\eta) d\theta dy
\label{eu}
\end{equation}
where $p(\theta|\mathbf{y},\eta)$ represents the posterior probability of $\theta$ given the design $\eta$ and data $\mathbf{y}$ and, $p(y|\eta)$ is the predictive distribution of $\mathbf{y}$. Finding the design that is optimal given a utility function, reduces to the problem of finding the values for the variables in $\eta$ for which equation \ref{eu} takes it's maximum value. However, for many applications the requiered integration is not a trivial problem, therefore, one could rely on analytic or numeric approximations to solve it.

% Perhaps i should present the formal arguments first a set of designs eta that belongs to...

Many utility functions have been proposed for both linear and non-linear design problems, however, as was previously mentioned, the choice of a utility function depends on the research question. For example, \cite{Myung2009} used the sum of squered errors between the data generated by a model and the predictions of a competing one given an expeirmental design. This is because, the objective is to find a design that can discriminate the predictions of the two. On the other hand, \cite{ZL2010} choose a utility function based on the Bayes Factor. Both of this functions will have their advantages, nontheless, the first, emphasizes disciminability of model's predictions, while the second one aims for a design in which the data generating model is more likely.

When the objective of the experiment is to make an inference about the parameters of a generalized linear model, some authors \citep[e.g.][]{Ber1979} have proposed to consider the gain in Shanon's Information as a utility function. In this case, the objective is to find the design $\eta$ that maximizes the expected gain in Shanon Information, or equvalently, maximizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the posterior and prior distribution. With this function, the expected utility of an experimental design is represented by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
U(\eta)=\int \int log\frac{p(\theta|y,\eta)}{p(\theta)} p(y,\theta |\eta) d\theta dy
\label{klu}
\end{equation}
The prior distribution in the denominator of the logarithm can be droped as it does not depend on the experimental design, therefore, the optimal design will be the one that maximizes:
\begin{equation}
U(\eta)=\int \int log \{p(\theta|y,\eta)\} p(y,\theta |\eta) d\theta dy
\label{egShanon}
\end{equation}
which is the posterior expected Shanon information. The objective of this function will be to minimize the posterior variance of the model's parameters, however, there are other utility functions that can be used for design optimization for generalized linear models. A good overview of some of this functions for linear and nonlinear design problems can be found in \citet{ChalonerVerdinelli1995}. 

When dealing with generalized linear models, the posterior distribution of the parameter vector $\theta$ is not always tractable, however, in the literature of design optimization it is common to use the normal approximation to the posterior distribution
\begin{equation}
\theta|y,\eta \sim N\left(\hat{\theta},[nI(\hat{\theta},\eta)]^{-1}\right)
\label{Naprox}
\end{equation}
Where $I(\hat{\theta},\eta)$ denotes the observed fisher information matrix given an experimental design and $\hat{\theta}$ is the maximum likelihood estimate of $\theta$. Even with this, the marginal distribution of the data ($p(y|\eta)$) in equation \ref{eu} needs to be aproximated, however, when the posterior utility only depends on $y$ through some constistent estimate of $\hat{\theta}$, a further approximation is to take the predictive distribution of  $\hat{\theta}$ to be the prior distribution \cite{chalar1989}.

With both aproximations, the value of $U(\eta)$ is:
\begin{equation}
U(\eta)=-\frac{k}{2}log(2\pi)-\frac{k}{2}+\frac{1}{2} \int log \{det[nI(\theta,\eta)]\} p(\theta) d\theta
\label{aproxu1}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{aproxu1} gives the exact expected utility of an esperimental design. However, one could drop the constant and multiplier terms giving the following form:
\begin{align}
\phi(\eta) & = \int log \{det[nI(\theta,\eta)]\} p(\theta) d\theta \\
           & = \mathbb{E}_\theta \left( log\{det[nI(\theta,\eta)]\} \right)
\label{crit1}
\end{align}
the function $\phi(\eta)$ is known as a design critirion. An optimal design would be the one maximizing equation \ref{crit1}, nontheless, it is worth noting that this relies on the normal approximation to the posterior distribution in \ref{Naprox}, therefore, for small smaples there are some constraints that can help to assure normality \citep[see][]{CLCH2002}. This kind of criteria can be found for other utility functions. For example, \citet{chalar1989} presented the derivation and application of two design criteria, one of which was $\phi(\eta)$. The second criterion, aims to optimize a design where a certain predictions of the model are of interest.

Finally, to check if a particular design is optimal, one needs to use the concept of the directional derivative \citep[see][]{chalar1989}. In this case, we denote $x$ as a design which puts all the weight on a single point $x$ in the experimental space $X$. The derivative of a design $\eta$ in the direction of the design $x$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
d(\eta,x)=\lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \epsilon^{-1}(\phi((1-\epsilon) \eta+\epsilon x)-\phi(\eta))
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INTRO PRARAGRAPHS REMOVED %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% When designing an experiment, often one starts by making decisions about the number of participants, how many and what values of our independent variable we should test or how many times should we test those values. Most of the time, these choices are made on the basis of previous research on the field. However, it might be the case that there is not enough information to make these decisions with confidence, or that the values that are commonly used, do not allow for strong conclusions. Optimal Experimental Design (OED) offers an alternative to solve this kind of problems through a re-interpretation of the experimental design as a desicion problem in which the objective is to maximaze a utility function.

% This function is a numeric representation of our preference over the possible consequences of running the experiment. Therefore, the optimization of an experimental design requires us to have a formal interpretation of the purpose of the experiment.
%For example, \citet{Myung2009} use a function that assigns a greater utility to designs that can discriminate between the predictions of two competing models, whereas, \citet{ZL2010} assign greater value to designs where the data generating model is the most likely. The objective in both examples is the same, however, the considerations of what makes a model good, play a role in the selection of the function. In the first case, models should predict different data patterns, in the second, the model that is favored by the evidence should be the one that generated the data.

%The objective of this paper is to present an introductory example of OED with a model that is commonly used in the Psychophysical and Decision Making literature, the logistic response model. 

%The concept of optimizing an experimental design is not new to psychological research. There are already examples of design optimization in the literature \citep[e.g.][]{Myung2009,ZL2010}. Both of this examples discuss and demonstrate the advantages of OED for model comparison in psychology. 

%In particular, we will present an example of OED in the context of Generalized Linear Models. These models are widely used in psychophysics. The problem that will be treated here is fairly new, however, the methodological aspects remain the same even with more straight-forward psychophysical experiments. In order to do this, we will use a particular parametrization of the logistic model which is primarily used in statistics.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% OED PRARAGRAPHS REMOVED %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Once we have defined the design space $\eta$, the objective of the experiment and the prior informartion $p(\theta)$, the expected utility of a design is represented by the following equation:
% \begin{equation}
% U(\eta)=\int \int U(\eta,y,\theta)p(\theta|y,\eta)p(y|\eta) d\theta dy
% \label{eu}
% \end{equation}
% Therefore, finding the experimental design that is optimal given a utility function, reduces to the problem of finding the values for the variables in $\eta$ for which equation \ref{eu} takes it's maximum value.

%To apply the concepts of OED to a particular problem, first, we need to define the elements of the design space. This space is conformed by the variables that we can manipulate during the experiment, for example, the values that our independent variable might take or the weight (proportion of observations) assigned to each of those values. These elements are the ones that we can modify in order to optimize the design.

%The second step would be to formalise the objective of the experiment. For example, in the case of a logistic model, we might want to find the values of our independent variable that minimize the variance of the model parameters, or we might be interested in the magnitude of the physical stimulus for which the probability of a response takes on a certain value. The formalization of the research question will define a utility function.

%The last step is to specify the prior information that we have about the problem at hand. This last step can be carried out in two ways, first, we can try to optimize the experiment for a particular guess about the parameter values of the model of interest, or we could use a probability distribution to account for the uncertainty in the values that we are interested in. This last step is primarily important to the optimization process in generalized linear models, because the optimal design will depend on the values of the parameters.
